The `for in` construct can be used to iterate an `Iterator`, a lazy value
generator (more details later). One of the easiest ways to create an iterator
is to use the range notation. `a..b` will yield values from `a` (inclusive) to 
`b` (exclusive) in steps of one.

Let's write FizzBuzz using `for` instead of `while`.
