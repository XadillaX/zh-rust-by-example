# Rust by Example

[Rust][rust] is a programming language with a focus on
type safety, memory safety, concurrency and performance.

This book is a collection of bitesize examples that illustrate various rustic
concepts and the Rust distribution libraries. The source code is hosted
[here][home].

Be sure to have Rust [installed][install] and the [docs][std] at hand,
and let's start!

*Note*: This book will follow the nightly version of Rust until we reach
version 1.0; it's highly possible that some examples won't work with snapshot
versions like 0.10, so be sure to use a nightly version!
