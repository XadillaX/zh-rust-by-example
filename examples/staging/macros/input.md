Rust provides a powerful macro system that allows metaprogramming. As you've
seen in previous chapters, macros look like functions, except that their name
ends with a bang `!`, but instead of generating a function call, macros are
expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program.

Macros are created using the `macro_rules!` macro.
